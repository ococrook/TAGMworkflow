This workflow describes a computational workflow for the Bayesian
analysis of spatial proteomics data. The algorithms and applications
are detailed in Crook et al. [A Bayesian mixture modelling approach
for spatial
proteomics](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006516).
